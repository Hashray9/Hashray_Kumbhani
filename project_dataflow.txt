=== SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ===
Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite.
Hosting: Local development using Vite server.

=== DATA FLOW ===
1. User lands on page -> App component renders.
2. Sections (Hero, About, Startup, Contact) are rendered as children.
3. Interactions (Buttons, Links) trigger standard browser navigation or anchors.

=== ERROR HANDLING ===
- Standard React error boundaries (if applicable in future).
- Browser console for runtime errors.
